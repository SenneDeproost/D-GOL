# D-GOL (Distributed Game of Life)
D-GOL is a project to find a solution to a distributation problem of a complex simulation. The Game of Life automata is chosen for it's simplicity and it's use of a field. D-GOL has to allow further expirimentation with similar games, so flexibility of the code is nescesary.
